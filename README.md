## A practical WinUI 3 demo showcasing `RichEditBox` in `MathMode`.
This app demonstrates how to enable and automate math input in a WinUI 3 application using `RichEditBox` with `RichEditMathMode` (introduced in Windows App SDK 1.7). It covers Nearly Plain Text (NPT) Unicode input, real-time formula rendering, and programmatic Unicode injection via the Win32 `SendInput` API. Ideal for developers building math-heavy UIs, educational tools, or custom equation editors.
