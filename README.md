## A practical WinUI 3 demo showcasing `RichEditBox` in `MathMode`.
This app demonstrates how to enable and automate math input in a WinUI 3 application using `RichEditBox` with `RichEditMathMode` (introduced in Windows App SDK 1.7). It covers Nearly Plain Text (NPT) Unicode input, real-time formula rendering, and programmatic Unicode injection via the Win32 `SendInput` API. Ideal for developers building math-heavy UIs, educational tools, or custom equation editors.

## Automating Math Input in WinUI 3 Using `RichEditBox` and `SendInput`: A Practical Guide to NPT and Unicode Injection

To add math input to your WinUI 3 application, start with the `RichEditBox` control. Since **Windows App SDK 1.7**, it supports a new feature called **RichEditMathMode**, which allows the control to interpret and convert text into MathML in real time. For example, typing `\pi` renders as **œÄ**, and `1/2` becomes **¬Ω**.
```cs
MathEditor.TextDocument.SetMathMode(RichEditMathMode.MathOnly);
```
You don‚Äôt need to write MathML manually. Instead, it uses a system called **Nearly Plain Text Unicode (NPT)**, a structured input format that maps common math sequences (like `\infty`, `\sum`, `\sqrt`, etc.) to Unicode symbols. These symbols are then rendered as MathML behind the scenes.

Why is this necessary? Because many math symbols (like integrals, Greek letters, or arrows) aren‚Äôt available on any physical keyboard. NPT acts as a semantic shorthand, making it possible to input complex formulas with plain text.

There are two things you must understand to use this effectively:

1. Learn the available NPT input sequences (Unicode math tables).
2. Trigger rendering by sending a `U+0020` (space) or pressing Enter, this finalizes the math input and forces the control to parse and render it properly.

The problem is, if you're building an app that involves math input, **you can‚Äôt expect users to memorize the entire NPT Unicode spec**, unless your target audience is a group of monks who‚Äôve taken a vow to speak only in NPT Unicode üòÇ.

Let‚Äôs be real: users want to click `œÄ` button and see œÄ, not study a Unicode textbook.

So, what‚Äôs the solution? You do the typing for them.

But here‚Äôs the catch: **WinUI 3 / Windows App SDK doesn‚Äôt provide a built-in way to inject raw Unicode characters into a `RichEditBox`**, especially not in a way that triggers MathMode rendering.

That‚Äôs where the **Win32 `SendInput` API** comes in.

`SendInput` is a low-level Windows API that lets you simulate **keyboard or mouse input**, just as if the user typed it. It bypasses the limitations of the high-level UI frameworks by writing directly to the input buffer of the focused window.

In this case, we use it to:

* Send Unicode characters (not keycodes or key names)
* Trigger special math input sequences programmatically
* Mimic real user input to activate RichEditBox‚Äôs MathMode rendering

Behind the scenes, we create and dispatch a series of synthetic keyboard events (keydown and keyup) for each Unicode character. This lets us inject unicode chars and sequences like `\u03C0` or `\u25A0(1&&@&1&@&&1)` directly into the control, no physical keyboard needed, no language switching required.

It‚Äôs a bit hacky, but it works flawlessly, and it‚Äôs the only reliable way to automate Unicode math input in a RichEditBox as of today (This is the best I could do, for now üòÇ).
